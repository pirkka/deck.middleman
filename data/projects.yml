          Finnish teleoperator <a href='http://elisa.fi/'>Elisa</a> wanted to create a marketing campaign based on a casual
          ice hockey game for smart phones. I was part of the initial concept design team at <a href="http://n2nolla.fi/" title="Palvelumuotoilu N2 Nolla">N2 Nolla</a> and ultimately ended up doing
          3D iPhone programming, real time audio analysis, scoring server and Facebook integration for the project. The game was eventually
          ported to Android by <a href="http://www.enemy.fi/" title="Enemy &amp; Sons Oy">Enemy &amp; Sons</a> and to Windows Phone by <a href="http://www.blendmedia.fi/" title="blend_media">Blend Media</a>.

          Basso Media runs a radio station broadcasting on FM in five cities in Finland.

  - title: Futudesign
    text: |
          Futudesign is <em>the</em> forum for architects operating in Finland.
          I was commissioned to create a new platform for the community based on initial design by Teemu Sepp&auml;nen, the creator of the original Futudesign message board.
          The result was a fully real-time publishing/discussion platform.
